                                I believe that the best AI experiences don't feel like AI at all â€” they feel intuitive, trustworthy, and genuinely helpful.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over the past five years, I've specialized in designing enterprise platforms that harness AI's power while maintaining the human touch that makes technology truly valuable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My approach combines rigorous user research, rapid prototyping, and close collaboration with engineering teams to create solutions that scale across complex organizations.
