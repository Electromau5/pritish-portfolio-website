                                I began my career in enterprise design at Verizon, focusing on large-scale systems that serve complex workflows and use-cases. At the DOE, I shifted toward Enterprise AI, where the role of design expanded beyond usability to shaping how people work with intelligent systems.

                                My belief has evolved: the best AI doesn't feel like AI â€” it feels human. It guides, supports, and empowers without overwhelming. Human-AI collaboration should enhance decision-making, not replace it.

                                I focus on designing AI-powered tools that are scalable, intuitive, and grounded in user research. By collaborating closely with engineers, I ensure these systems meet real needs while staying adaptable in fast-moving environments.
